# Crashy

A Zig playground that will most likely crash all the time.

We gotta learn things somehow, right?

## Dependencies

This project depends on some native, globally available libs, namely:

```
glfw
```

This also expects to be running on macOS for now. If you find linking issues, try building with `ZIG_SYSTEM_LINKER_HACK=1`.
